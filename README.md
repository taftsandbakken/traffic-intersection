# Traffic Intersection Simulator
Implementation of a traffic intersection simulator with multiple lanes, crosswalks, and smart sensors using angular in a web app.

Start the simulation on auto (cars come on their own) or manual (click on the incoming lanes to make cars appear). Click on pedestrian buttons to make the crosswalk safe to cross.
